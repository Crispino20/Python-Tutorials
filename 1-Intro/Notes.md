## Python Formatter

One of the most popular formatters for Python is Pep 8. When you execute it, it reviews your entire document and styles it accordingly, adding indentation, spacing etc where it deems fit, for better readability. 

## Installing PEP 8 Python formatter 

- I installed `autopep8` from the extension store and reloaded VS code 
- To format written code using pep 8 standard, you can use one of 3 methods:
  - Open command pallete clicking on `View` > selecting `Command Palette` > typing `Format` and selecting `Format document` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + P`
  - Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcut for formatting `Shift + Alt + F`
  - Better yet, you can have the formatting automatically applied each time you make a change and save (This is the method I've opted for). To do this go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` > `Text Editor` > `Formatting` > Tick the checkbox `Format On Save`.
