# Variables 

## Naming conventions
- Always make variable names descriptive to inform on their purpose. Giving an undescriptive name such as `x` or `c1` is bad practice. 
- Use lower case letters for naming variables.
- Use underscore to separate multiple words e.g `student_name`. In python, this is prefered to camel casing, though it's a matter of preference. 
- Always put a space before and after the equal sign e.g `student_name = 'John'` as this make your code readable.
