# Variables Practice

# Exercise 1: Simple math
# Store two numbers in variables.
# Print their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

num1 = 10
num2 = 50

total = num1 + num2
difference = num2 - num1
product = num1 * num2
quotient = num2 // num1

print("Exercise 1:")
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", total)
print(num2, "-", num1, "is", difference)
print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is", product)
print("The quotient of", num2, "and", num1, "is", quotient)

# Exercise 2: Perimeter of a rectangle

# - Create variables length and width.
# - Calculate and print the perimeter.
# - (Formula: 2 * (length + width))

length = 10
width = 20
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print("Exercise 2:")
print("The perimeter of a rectangle with a length of",
      length, "and a width of", width, "is", perimeter)

# Exercise 3: Average of three numbers
# Store 3 test scores in variables.
# Print their average.

result1 = 50
result2 = 60
result3 = 55
average = (result1 + result2 + result3)/3
print("Exercise 3:")
print("The average test score is", average)
